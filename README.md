## Inspiration
My friends and I have always shared books, and I wanted a way to see whats on my friends bookshelves and borrow those books
Origionally I thought this interaction could be made into a subscription model where you pay Â£X a month, then you can request a book from anyones bookshelf. A Postage sticker would then be sent to the book owner, who sends their book on. The recipient would then send it back once finished. Currently the price of return postage on a book is similar to the price of the book itself. So I thought for now it would be nice for friends to be able to share, without getting into a pricing structure 

I'm also heavily influenced by https://letterboxd.com/, which I use constantly. I love being able to see what my frineds have watched, and being able to message them about what they thought about it. Using it constantly also gives you a wealth of stats that you can review and compare with friends
